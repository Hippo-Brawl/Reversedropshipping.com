# Fix for TikTok Video Download Issue

## Problem
The script was downloading the same 3 videos repeatedly instead of getting the latest videos when requesting different amounts (like 50 videos).

## Root Causes
1. **Poor file naming**: Videos were being overwritten due to filename conflicts
2. **Inefficient downloading**: The script wasn't properly handling individual video downloads
3. **No temp folder clearing**: Old files were interfering with new downloads
4. **Missing error handling**: Failed downloads weren't being handled properly

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Improved File Naming**
- **Before**: `%(title)s.%(ext)s` - Could cause conflicts
- **After**: `video_{i+1:03d}_%(title)s.%(ext)s` - Sequential numbering (001, 002, etc.)
- **Result**: Each video gets a unique filename

### 2. **Individual Download Handling**
- **Before**: Single yt-dlp instance for all downloads
- **After**: Separate yt-dlp instance for each video
- **Result**: Better control over each download

### 3. **Temp Folder Management**
- **Added**: `clear_temp_folder()` method
- **Called**: Before starting new downloads
- **Result**: No interference from previous downloads

### 4. **Better Error Handling**
- **Added**: `ignoreerrors=True` to continue if some videos fail
- **Added**: Better file detection after download
- **Added**: Progress reporting for successful downloads

### 5. **Enhanced Configuration**
```python
ydl_opts = {
    'format': 'best[ext=mp4]',
    'outtmpl': str(self.temp_folder / f'video_{i+1:03d}_%(title)s.%(ext)s'),
    'playlistreverse': False,  # Get latest videos first
    'extract_flat': False,
    'ignoreerrors': True,  # Continue if some videos fail
}
```

## Key Improvements

### ✅ **Sequential Numbering**
- Files now named: `video_001_title.mp4`, `video_002_title.mp4`, etc.
- No more filename conflicts

### ✅ **Latest Videos First**
- `playlistreverse': False` ensures latest videos are downloaded first
- Proper handling of TikTok's video ordering

### ✅ **Clean Start**
- Temp folder cleared before each run
- No old files interfering with new downloads

### ✅ **Better Progress Tracking**
- Clear feedback on which videos are being downloaded
- Success/failure indicators for each video

### ✅ **Robust Error Handling**
- Continues downloading even if some videos fail
- Better file detection and validation

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Run `python test_tiktok.py` to verify TikTok extraction works
2. Run `python main.py` and try different video counts
3. Check that you get the expected number of unique videos

## Expected Behavior Now
- **Request 5 videos**: Gets latest 5 videos from profile
- **Request 50 videos**: Gets latest 50 videos from profile
- **Each run**: Gets fresh, latest videos (not cached ones)
- **File naming**: Sequential and unique for each video
